[Mon Nov  1 23:06:47 2021] Darkness in the room is broken as the sun shines through the window.  A glossy pink bubble glistens in the light.  Second by second, the light inches its way forth, illuminating a four-limbed creature curled in restful slumber on the orb. The sound of distant birds can be heard faintly from inside.
**Deet deet deet deet. Deet deet deet deet. Deet deet deet deet.**
THUMP.

The creature's bed spirals in the air as its owner is dumped onto a soft red carpeted floor in a haphazard sprawl. 
"Guhhh." The creature blows their red mane off of their face, and after a few more moments to rest, rolls purposefully onto its back. 
"What day is it?"

The creature gazes intently at a blue glowing device on their left foreleg. Then slips a large claw from their other foreleg into a red globe protruding from a panel adjacent to the screen of the device.

"Sunday?" they squeak, "Why did the alarm go off then? Weird. But that's OK, I've got plenty to do today." A few taps and wiggles later, the beeping of the device subsides. 

In an instant, the creature prances upright on all four limbs, stretches each leg one at a time, and then pounces for the door, their bed gradually rocking to a stop in the corner where she had awakened.
[23:06:48] Moments later, the creature arrives at another door. They reach out, bumping the doorbell with the back of their paw. Ding. A few seconds pass. The door pings, and then slides open. Another creature- grey with a pale underside and blood red eyes- is waiting. Their eyes are unfocused, clearly still drowsy.
"Morning, Pinks. Did you change clothes?"
"Nope!"
"Washed up?"
"Nuh-uh."
"Ready to go?"
"Anytime!"

The two stare at each other intently. The pink one, as if daring the grey one to protest. The grey one as if they've heard a terrible pun for the tenth time. The grey one turns with a slight frown and a sigh.

"At least go do a quick rinse. If you wanna compete in the tournament today, it's only fair to show up your fresh best."
Pinks hops back, a little surprised. "Oh! Wait! That's today!?"

"Yes, it's today! You've been telling me about it every day for the past month, how did you forget?"

The grey one gingerly nudges Pinks towards the washroom. 
"And we have assessments tomorrow. Teams. Get washed, and I'll get everything ready for us to ride down to Console."

They pounce off into the wash room, curtains sliding into place behind them.

Spree
[Tue Nov  2 01:50:37 2021] --
The pair slow their sprint to a casual pace as they approach the shopping block of the coast. A set of brightly colored buildings arranged in an L formation. The windows are covered with notices and adverts. "HELP WANTED", "6 pack of Emmelo's, 30% off", "Full meals available at NOON". Colorful striped curtains hang over the windows and palm trees cast shadows in jagged patterns across the buildings.

The sun is still low and the sky ablaze with streaks of amber, violet, and rose streaks of light. They come to a stop in front of a cream colored building. A banner on the front reads "Vipen's Bust a Motors'" A large acryllic standee is visible behind the windows of a giant kangaroo woman in a red formal dress and a pink wig. The expression of the figure welcomes customers into the shop. But the lights inside the building are dim, and nobody can be seen moving inside. A row of four scooters lies close to the red building, each with thick black cables attached on the side, connecting them to the building.

The grey creature steps ahead of its companion, taking a closer look through the glass double doors. The doors do not slide open. They then check for any kind of doorbell or buzzers to use, but finds nothing. The pink creature watches with keen eyes.

"That's odd. I called ahead. They said they'ld be here."
"I'm here!" a voice thundered, seemingly right into their ears. A large kangaroo- the living counterpart of the standee seen inside- trudges from around the corner of the buildings and right past the grey creature to the door.
[02:09:49] "I'm here. I was making breakfast for the kids and we were out of honey, so I needed to improvise. Anyway-"
She promptly scans a keycard. Beep. And then deftly lifts a key from her pouch and slips it into a keyhole next to the doors. With a click, the doors slide open. She steps in and turns on the lights.

"Hard Reset?" the Kangaroo nods to the grey creature who nods back in return, "I got your reservation. You can take any two of the scooters out here, as long as you turn it at our branch in Console or back here before the day is over."

She ducks briefly behind the counter and returns back with a small handheld wireless scanner projecting a red beam She manipulates the touchscreen on the back with practiced ease. "What's your Usutag?" 

The Kangaroo takes another look at the pair of early customers. She chuckles and grin at the pink one, pouncing about in circles following a butterfly. "You and your friend? If you don't have one, a library card will work just as well"

Hard Reset turns to look at his partner. Bemused, he stands upright, plucks the pink one out of the air with both forelegs, and gently sets them down right in front of the shop worker. He raises his forelimb towards the Kangaroo, presenting the device on his left leg. When she looks at it, the red screen blinks, flickers, and then glows ominously. "We just scan these?"

The Kangaroo passes over the red screen with the scanner. A trio of rhythmic pulses emits from the scanner, followed by a beep. "Hard Reset. Exactly as you said. And-"
The worker brings the scanner towards the pink critter, who presents their own mechanical cuff in a similar fashion.
"First Post. You're good to go. Those scooters are all fully charged and rated for 120 miles of travel. More than enough to get you there and back. Though, the green one has an issue with the basket not staying stable. If you have anything loose, don't take that one."
"Thank you, miss." Reset answered.
"Thanks a bunch!" Post echoed.
[02:10:57] The two went back to examine the set of scooters at the front, judging the colors and shapes. But there isn't much variety between them. And the worker withdrew into the depths of the building, turning on lights and tidying up the interior as they went.
