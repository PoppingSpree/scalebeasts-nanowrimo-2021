# scalebeasts-nanowrimo-2021
A contemporary sci-fi tale of the transition of an island from a post-revolution anarchist experiment to the haven of #SCALEBEASTS. Born as a #SCALEBEAST, raised by G.U.N.S. fugitives, and socialized into the collectivist culture of Yohz Hylan, "Honey Bee" Beatrice doesn't know who to trust, where should she live, or what she even is.  Feeling certain that the people around her are no more enlightened than her, Bee and her companions embark on a quest to explore the world around them and find the "right" place to live, be it among the stars or right back where they started.
