[[What happens when I put notes in double brackets like this? This might be a good way for me to do annotations as I write... Then when it's ready to publish, I can just delete annotations. Looks like they just persist as-is. That's fine. Let's proceed with annotations then.]]



[[Section: FP and HR scoot down to Console, at some point they ask why they don't just run... maybe ask why they didn't just run AFTER the event and have already returned the scooters. Maybe somebody else has borrowed all of them and they decide to run back out of necessity.]]



[[Section: Description of general Console outline, depicting it as more computer oriented. Screens, holograms, etc. Populace is many other Squee and HBuster of the large variety. The islanders that do reside here tend to be young adults, small by comparison, and very often the equivalent of kink-loaded techie furries in our world. Maybe have some kind of signange indicating the origins of being Squee-built. Stabletech allusions maybe?]]



[[Section: FP arrives at the arcade. Detail desc for the arcade interior maybe. HR and FP recap the plan for the next few hours. HR has other things to take care of locally later in the day (probably conveniently and unknowingly not be around when Pepper shows up, but will be probably be around to watch the match. Place is starting to fill up with others who are also competing in the games. FP, unsurprisingly, gets to to play first with (pick some opponent, probably another Squee so we can have FP assess how non-HBuster go about things.)]]


[[Defining the rules of the game, just have it be a constructed room version of the puzzle game as if it were happening in a cylndrical well. There is an audience, but it is fairly small because it is still early. Also might be a good time to get into the details of how broadcast shenanigans work, or handwave it for later. Assuming Dazzle is still around and kicking, might be cool if she's one of the people announcing... or have a split team of a residential villager and a Helibuster split the work on broadcasting. Play out the game.]]


[[FP wins and advances. Maybe spots HR cheering somewhere in the audience, even if there's nobody else up there. Gets to come off stage for a break. while things continue.]]


[[If there are other characters we want to showcase (Bee? Wifi? Get Bonus?) now might be a good time to have them show up and give off a general vibe and short desc before we encounter them proper. If we have Bee and Wifi here, that only gives them one day lead time to go exploring prior the assessments and whatnot for FP and HR to be assigneed to tracking her down.]]
