[[What happens when I put notes in double brackets like this? This might be a good way for me to do annotations as I write... Then when it's ready to publish, I can just delete annotations. Looks like they just persist as-is. That's fine. Let's proceed with annotations then.]]

"Dibs on this one." With little hesitation, Hard Reset unplugged a firey red scooter from the set and promptly strattled the seat.

First Post made looked back and forth between a blue scooter with bright sparkly yellow stars on it, and a purple scooter with magenta stripes. She giggled at Reset's pace. "Always with the red. You love red, don't you?"
"No." A snappy answer. Their head tilted moments later. "I don't know. It just feels right?" First Post reached behind the blue scooter, grasping the power connection. "Actually," Reset continued, "I prefer blue. My shells are always blue."

Seemingly having changed her mind at the last second, First Post pounced back once, and then sprung again right onto the seat of the purple stripey scooter. She leaned back and disconnected the charging cable with a hind leg and tucked it onto the hook on the wall. Then she leaned forward, reached for the power switch, and turned the scooter on. Reset turned theirs on as well.

"No..." First Post grinned, "You're just saying that so you avoid complimenting me, aren't you?" Reset chirped, unable to get words out in time. "My shells are usually clear or pink, but that's just because it's easy and natural. If I were gonna pick any color I wanted, I'd go with red. Or purple. Or maybe gold! Or, I know, I could do all three!"

"Look, it's not like that. I like red. I like you too- when you don't have your head in the clouds- I just don't think about color a lot. There's always more important things to worry about. Like getting you to your appointments on time."

The two brought their scooters to a casual pace along the pavement, side by side. Both scooters emitting a gentle but consistent hum signalicing their presence. 
"Yeah, yeah. Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. We're so early, we'd have time to go shopping before things kick off... Maybe one of these things when things are less busy, we should try changing things up a bit. You could wear my clothes and I could wear yours. You try some different colors of gear, I try to learn how you do that pinball thing-"
"Pin-Shell"
"and you try to loosten up a bit and have more fun."

[[Section: FP and HR scoot down to Console, at some point they ask why they don't just run... maybe ask why they didn't just run AFTER the event and have already returned the scooters. Maybe somebody else has borrowed all of them and they decide to run back out of necessity.]]



[[Section: Description of general Console outline, depicting it as more computer oriented. Screens, holograms, etc. Populace is many other Squee and HBuster of the large variety. The islanders that do reside here tend to be young adults, small by comparison, and very often the equivalent of kink-loaded techie furries in our world. Maybe have some kind of signange indicating the origins of being Squee-built. Stabletech allusions maybe?]]



[[Section: FP arrives at the arcade. Detail desc for the arcade interior maybe. HR and FP recap the plan for the next few hours. HR has other things to take care of locally later in the day (probably conveniently and unknowingly not be around when Pepper shows up, but will be probably be around to watch the match. Place is starting to fill up with others who are also competing in the games. FP, unsurprisingly, gets to to play first with (pick some opponent, probably another Squee so we can have FP assess how non-HBuster go about things.)]]


[[Defining the rules of the game, just have it be a constructed room version of the puzzle game as if it were happening in a cylndrical well. There is an audience, but it is fairly small because it is still early. Also might be a good time to get into the details of how broadcast shenanigans work, or handwave it for later. Assuming Dazzle is still around and kicking, might be cool if she's one of the people announcing... or have a split team of a residential villager and a Helibuster split the work on broadcasting. Play out the game.]]


[[FP wins and advances. Maybe spots HR cheering somewhere in the audience, even if there's nobody else up there. Gets to come off stage for a break. while things continue.]]


[[If there are other characters we want to showcase (Bee? Wifi? Get Bonus?) now might be a good time to have them show up and give off a general vibe and short desc before we encounter them proper. If we have Bee and Wifi here, that only gives them one day lead time to go exploring prior the assessments and whatnot for FP and HR to be assigneed to tracking her down.]]
