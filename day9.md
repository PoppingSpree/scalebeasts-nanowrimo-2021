Seated at the tables in front of the display windows are a pair of cozy friends. One, a petite brown bear in an oversized red cartoon-bearing shirt and a black denim vest. Her name is Feluxutiria- as is written on her backback. The other, a quadruped that looked in all respects like a sparkly blue miniture horse with pointy weaponized party hat attached to its forehead.

It's clear the two are close. The way they stick togehter at all times. The way the bear could ramble at length about the most inane things and have the blue one nod eagery to it. The way that despite saying few words, the blue one seemed at ease and perfectly understood by their companion.

"We'll have a double order of the salmon meal, please." The beaer had ordered.

Miela had heard word about the "Toys" around town, and how in the past they had had quite the conflict with the broader community living on the island. And while she had seen a few now and then in other shops or passing about during the day to day, she had never really gotten to known any nor really spoken to any much. She had never ever seen one show an interest in the Hot Tropics before.

It was as if the Toys didn't eat at all, or at least didn't eat the same kind of food the other people around tended to eat. That did make intuitive sene to her. After all, when one buys a toy plush cat, that is with the expectation that they won't need to eat it. So why would Toy People need to eat anything either?

She brought the freshly cooked meals to the table. Both, pristine white dishes with a bed of rice on top, heled in place by a healthy helping of zesty seasoned salmon and topped with a small variety of mixed herbs and spices. Miela nodded to both of them and smiled.

"Thanks for ordering at the Hot Tropics! We hope you enjoy your meal!" She promptly laid out the utensiles for the both of them with the practiced ease of someone who's done this routine thousands of times, beamed a warm grin at the both of the patrons, then retreated back behind the counter to reseume work taking glances at the pair when time permitted.
