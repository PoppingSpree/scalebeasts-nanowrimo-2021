It was a relatively quiet day in the Hot Tropics. Customers frequently made their orders online, passed by the pickup lane to get their food, and left to eat. While the seats and tables were still in place to accomodate many patrons, it had been years since all of the seats had been filled. And this was fine. Less maintence. Less confrontations with upset customers. While sometimes the amount of orders coming in might be more than they could ever possibly fill at once- and issue they seldom had when people were accustomed to ordering in person- more often than not there pwas ample time to rest, relax, think, read, or clean between orders. And with little fear of appearing to not take their work in front of their clients, Spica and Miela enjoyed chatting with eachother or with the customers now and then. Though the missed the old arrangement, the horse-women became comfortable with the new work cadence.

Today is a bit different.
