[[Section: Description of general Console outline, depicting it as more computer oriented. Screens, holograms, etc. Populace is many other Squee and HBuster of the large variety. The islanders that do reside here tend to be young adults, small by comparison, and very often the equivalent of kink-loaded techie furries in our world. Maybe have some kind of signange indicating the origins of being Squee-built. Stabletech allusions maybe?]]

As Console comes into view, it was immediately clear that an event is underway. Despite the low sun, plenty of residents were making their way across the sidewalk paths, slipping into restaurants and shops, or stepping into lines for their turn for various streetside services. The occasional bike, scooter, or motorcyle zooms by noisily. The salty scent of freshly cooked seafood danced on the air.

Glowing screens and holographic imagery can be seen all throughout the municipality, adorning the shops, on the sidewalks, projected in the air, replacing windows. A large sign marks the northern passage decorated with a holographic pair of dancing critters. One with a creamy, honey-toned rabbit-eared hourglass figure and the other an aggressively-magenta scaled beast with sparkling claws and a very round pear-like figure. Text near the extravagant display reads "CONSOLE.LOG A Happy Home for Helium Squee". As the grey and pink duo of visitors scooted under the display, a shower of simulated confetti rains on them, flickering briefly with static as their bodies past through the display.

The two bring their scooters to stop in front of Vipens building and before they can dismount-

"Um excuse me, mind if we borrow these?
The speaker is a massive green Squee, with a long ponytail and ears that droop all the way down to its round orb tail. They work a black hoodie, the hood down and the rim ending just above the waist.The Squee's colors in particular sparkle, light reflecting off of metalic flecs in their flesh. Despite towering easily two times the height of First Post, the voice of the Squee is rather soft and high pitched. Gentle, but urgent. 

Around their neck, a golden canine woman had her arms wrapped. Clad in a red hoodie and nothing below the waist, she had a muzzle buried against against the back of the hood of their companion, showing no acknowledgement of the things going on around her.

First Post dismounted. 

"Uh. Sure, take what you need, we're done with these for the day. Right?" 

She turned to Hard Rest for confirmation. They started to shrug, then nodded.

"Certainy, that's what they're for. Just return them when you're done." Hard Reset tilted their gaze at the canine hanger-on. "Is everything OK?"
