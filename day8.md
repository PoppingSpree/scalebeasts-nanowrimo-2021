[[You didn't actually write anything for day 8 silly, you let Terraria rule your life and your schedule. You're stronger than this. Don't let it keep going.]]

[[The following is a reflection on my experience with NaNoWriMo so far:]]

Four lessons from my first week of trying to force a novel into existence

1:  "Write Every Day" sounds all fine and dandy until getting sick from eating some funky food or having an emotional argument with friends. Trying to write "happy fun fake-sports tournament" through that feels baaaaaaad.

2: Cheat Days are still Hard Days. When I was doing art challenges, I had "cheat day" prompts lined up, specifically so I could reach a quick finish on something low effort when I was feeling unwell. I tried doing a similar setup for NaNoWriMo and it is not working at all. First, because the cheat day prompts don't actually fit anywhere in the novel and so get forced in the back of it in a weird out of order glossary thing making it awkward to share. Second, because even an easy writing prompt takes a good chunk of time for me to write. I can't do a 15 minute "quick sketch" and get anywhere near 3k words.

3: "Show Don't Tell" is slow to write. It makes for a better reading experience most of the time, but but this turns into an easy detour into 30+ minutes of "research" when trying to do this for any situation I don't have more than surface level familiarity with. Trying to fudge the logistics, or just sticking a convenient timeskip at the exact moment of "I don't know how this part actually works" feels bad. The goal of NaNo is to just get a draft, not necessarily a good one. So I need to force myself to stop letting this be a pace breaker.

4: Writing the boring parts in my novel is at least as boring as reading the boring parts in other's novels, if not moreso. Somehow I just assumed all writers liked writing all of the parts of their stories. But I started my story with one of my popular characters so I could try to define what normalcy is, but I'm stuck spending days of my life trying to detail the logistics of a roadtrip instead of exploring a character questioning what it means to be a human that I wanted to do in the first place. I should probably just jump ahead and come back to the boring bits if I'm ever looking at getting past draft 1. 
basically what I'm saying is "art is hard"
