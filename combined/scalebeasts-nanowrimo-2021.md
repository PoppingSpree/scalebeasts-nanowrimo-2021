[Mon Nov  1 23:06:47 2021] Darkness in the room is broken as the sun shines through the window.  A glossy pink bubble glistens in the light.  Second by second, the light inches its way forth, illuminating a four-limbed creature curled in restful slumber on the orb. The sound of distant birds can be heard faintly from inside.
**Deet deet deet deet. Deet deet deet deet. Deet deet deet deet.**
THUMP.

The creature's bed spirals in the air as its owner is dumped onto a soft red carpeted floor in a haphazard sprawl. 
"Guhhh." The creature blows their red mane off of their face, and after a few more moments to rest, rolls purposefully onto its back. 
"What day is it?"

The creature gazes intently at a blue glowing device on their left foreleg. Then slips a large claw from their other foreleg into a red globe protruding from a panel adjacent to the screen of the device.

"Sunday?" they squeak, "Why did the alarm go off then? Weird. But that's OK, I've got plenty to do today." A few taps and wiggles later, the beeping of the device subsides. 

In an instant, the creature prances upright on all four limbs, stretches each leg one at a time, and then pounces for the door, their bed gradually rocking to a stop in the corner where she had awakened.
[23:06:48] Moments later, the creature arrives at another door. They reach out, bumping the doorbell with the back of their paw. Ding. A few seconds pass. The door pings, and then slides open. Another creature- grey with a pale underside and blood red eyes- is waiting. Their eyes are unfocused, clearly still drowsy.
"Morning, Pinks. Did you change clothes?"
"Nope!"
"Washed up?"
"Nuh-uh."
"Ready to go?"
"Anytime!"

The two stare at each other intently. The pink one, as if daring the grey one to protest. The grey one as if they've heard a terrible pun for the tenth time. The grey one turns with a slight frown and a sigh.

"At least go do a quick rinse. If you wanna compete in the tournament today, it's only fair to show up your fresh best."
Pinks hops back, a little surprised. "Oh! Wait! That's today!?"

"Yes, it's today! You've been telling me about it every day for the past month, how did you forget?"

The grey one gingerly nudges Pinks towards the washroom. 
"And we have assessments tomorrow. Teams. Get washed, and I'll get everything ready for us to ride down to Console."

They pounce off into the wash room, curtains sliding into place behind them.

Spree
[Tue Nov  2 01:50:37 2021] --
The pair slow their sprint to a casual pace as they approach the shopping block of the coast. A set of brightly colored buildings arranged in an L formation. The windows are covered with notices and adverts. "HELP WANTED", "6 pack of Emmelo's, 30% off", "Full meals available at NOON". Colorful striped curtains hang over the windows and palm trees cast shadows in jagged patterns across the buildings.

The sun is still low and the sky ablaze with streaks of amber, violet, and rose streaks of light. They come to a stop in front of a cream colored building. A banner on the front reads "Vipen's Bust a Motors'" A large acryllic standee is visible behind the windows of a giant kangaroo woman in a red formal dress and a pink wig. The expression of the figure welcomes customers into the shop. But the lights inside the building are dim, and nobody can be seen moving inside. A row of four scooters lies close to the red building, each with thick black cables attached on the side, connecting them to the building.

The grey creature steps ahead of its companion, taking a closer look through the glass double doors. The doors do not slide open. They then check for any kind of doorbell or buzzers to use, but finds nothing. The pink creature watches with keen eyes.

"That's odd. I called ahead. They said they'ld be here."
"I'm here!" a voice thundered, seemingly right into their ears. A large kangaroo- the living counterpart of the standee seen inside- trudges from around the corner of the buildings and right past the grey creature to the door.
[02:09:49] "I'm here. I was making breakfast for the kids and we were out of honey, so I needed to improvise. Anyway-"
She promptly scans a keycard. Beep. And then deftly lifts a key from her pouch and slips it into a keyhole next to the doors. With a click, the doors slide open. She steps in and turns on the lights.

"Hard Reset?" the Kangaroo nods to the grey creature who nods back in return, "I got your reservation. You can take any two of the scooters out here, as long as you turn it at our branch in Console or back here before the day is over."

She ducks briefly behind the counter and returns back with a small handheld wireless scanner projecting a red beam She manipulates the touchscreen on the back with practiced ease. "What's your Usutag?" 

The Kangaroo takes another look at the pair of early customers. She chuckles and grin at the pink one, pouncing about in circles following a butterfly. "You and your friend? If you don't have one, a library card will work just as well"

Hard Reset turns to look at his partner. Bemused, he stands upright, plucks the pink one out of the air with both forelegs, and gently sets them down right in front of the shop worker. He raises his forelimb towards the Kangaroo, presenting the device on his left leg. When she looks at it, the red screen blinks, flickers, and then glows ominously. "We just scan these?"

The Kangaroo passes over the red screen with the scanner. A trio of rhythmic pulses emits from the scanner, followed by a beep. "Hard Reset. Exactly as you said. And-"
The worker brings the scanner towards the pink critter, who presents their own mechanical cuff in a similar fashion.
"First Post. You're good to go. Those scooters are all fully charged and rated for 120 miles of travel. More than enough to get you there and back. Though, the green one has an issue with the basket not staying stable. If you have anything loose, don't take that one."
"Thank you, miss." Reset answered.
"Thanks a bunch!" Post echoed.
[02:10:57] The two went back to examine the set of scooters at the front, judging the colors and shapes. But there isn't much variety between them. And the worker withdrew into the depths of the building, turning on lights and tidying up the interior as they went.

[[What happens when I put notes in double brackets like this? This might be a good way for me to do annotations as I write... Then when it's ready to publish, I can just delete annotations. Looks like they just persist as-is. That's fine. Let's proceed with annotations then.]]

"Dibs on this one." With little hesitation, Hard Reset unplugged a firey red scooter from the set and promptly strattled the seat.

First Post looked back and forth between a blue scooter with bright sparkly yellow stars on it, and a purple scooter with magenta stripes. She giggled at Reset's pace. "Always with the red. You love red, don't you?"
"No." A snappy answer. Their head tilted moments later. "I don't know. It just feels right?" First Post reached behind the blue scooter, grasping the power connection. "Actually," Reset continued, "I prefer blue. My shells are always blue."

Seemingly having changed her mind at the last second, First Post pounced back once, and then sprung again right onto the seat of the purple stripey scooter. She leaned back and disconnected the charging cable with a hind leg and tucked it onto the hook on the wall. Then she leaned forward, reached for the power switch, and turned the scooter on. Reset turned theirs on as well.

"No..." First Post grinned, "You're just saying that so you avoid complimenting me, aren't you?" Reset chirped, unable to get words out in time. "My shells are usually clear or pink, but that's just because it's easy and natural. If I were gonna pick any color I wanted, I'd go with red. Or purple. Or maybe gold! Or, I know, I could do all three!"

"Look, it's not like that. I like red. I like you too- when you don't have your head in the clouds- I just don't think about color a lot. There's always more important things to worry about. Like getting you to your appointments on time."

The two brought their scooters to a casual pace along the pavement, side by side. Both scooters emitting a gentle but consistent hum signalicing their presence. 
"Yeah, yeah. Don't worry! Everything'll be fine. We're so early, we'd have time to go shopping before things kick off... Maybe one of these things when things are less busy, we should try changing things up a bit. You could wear my clothes and I could wear yours. You try some different colors of gear, I try to learn how you do that pinball thing-"
"Pin-Shell"
"and you try to loosten up a bit and have more fun."

[[Section: FP and HR scoot down to Console, at some point they ask why they don't just run... maybe ask why they didn't just run AFTER the event and have already returned the scooters. Maybe somebody else has borrowed all of them and they decide to run back out of necessity.]]



[[Section: Description of general Console outline, depicting it as more computer oriented. Screens, holograms, etc. Populace is many other Squee and HBuster of the large variety. The islanders that do reside here tend to be young adults, small by comparison, and very often the equivalent of kink-loaded techie furries in our world. Maybe have some kind of signange indicating the origins of being Squee-built. Stabletech allusions maybe?]]



[[Section: FP arrives at the arcade. Detail desc for the arcade interior maybe. HR and FP recap the plan for the next few hours. HR has other things to take care of locally later in the day (probably conveniently and unknowingly not be around when Pepper shows up, but will be probably be around to watch the match. Place is starting to fill up with others who are also competing in the games. FP, unsurprisingly, gets to to play first with (pick some opponent, probably another Squee so we can have FP assess how non-HBuster go about things.)]]


[[Defining the rules of the game, just have it be a constructed room version of the puzzle game as if it were happening in a cylndrical well. There is an audience, but it is fairly small because it is still early. Also might be a good time to get into the details of how broadcast shenanigans work, or handwave it for later. Assuming Dazzle is still around and kicking, might be cool if she's one of the people announcing... or have a split team of a residential villager and a Helibuster split the work on broadcasting. Play out the game.]]


[[FP wins and advances. Maybe spots HR cheering somewhere in the audience, even if there's nobody else up there. Gets to come off stage for a break. while things continue.]]


[[If there are other characters we want to showcase (Bee? Wifi? Get Bonus?) now might be a good time to have them show up and give off a general vibe and short desc before we encounter them proper. If we have Bee and Wifi here, that only gives them one day lead time to go exploring prior the assessments and whatnot for FP and HR to be assigneed to tracking her down.]]

[[Editing long texts is kind of a pain on Discord, but I need to go back and fill in each one of those Sections with the Actual Prose so writing the whole thing directly in the Discord text box isn't looking feasible. I'll figure out the workflow as I go, but for the time being I'm just yeeting stuff into github and copying over the relevant bits to the channel.]]

As Console comes into view, it was immediately clear that an event is underway. Despite the low sun, plenty of residents were making their way across the sidewalk paths, slipping into restaurants and shops, or stepping into lines for their turn for various streetside services. The occasional bike, scooter, or motorcyle zooms by noisily. The salty scent of freshly cooked seafood danced on the air.

Glowing screens and holographic imagery can be seen all throughout the municipality, adorning the shops, on the sidewalks, projected in the air, replacing windows. A large sign marks the northern passage decorated with a holographic pair of dancing critters. One with a creamy, honey-toned rabbit-eared hourglass figure and the other an aggressively-magenta scaled beast with sparkling claws and a very round pear-like figure. Text near the extravagant display reads "CONSOLE.LOG A Happy Home for Helium Squee". As the grey and pink duo of visitors scooted under the display, a shower of simulated confetti rains on them, flickering briefly with static as their bodies past through the display.

The two bring their scooters to stop in front of Vipens building and before they can dismount-

"Um excuse me, mind if we borrow these?
The speaker is a massive green Squee, with a long ponytail and ears that droop all the way down to its round orb tail. They work a black hoodie, the hood down and the rim ending just above the waist.The Squee's colors in particular sparkle, light reflecting off of metalic flecs in their flesh. Despite towering easily two times the height of First Post, the voice of the Squee is rather soft and high pitched. Gentle, but urgent. 

Around their neck, a golden canine woman had her arms wrapped. Clad in a red hoodie and nothing below the waist, she had a muzzle buried against against the back of the hood of their companion, showing no acknowledgement of the things going on around her.

First Post dismounted. 

"Uh. Sure, take what you need, we're done with these for the day. Right?" 

She turned to Hard Rest for confirmation. They started to shrug, then nodded.

"Certainy, that's what they're for. Just return them when you're done." Hard Reset tilted their gaze at the canine hanger-on. "Is everything OK?"

The Squee nodded gently, careful not to jostle the woman on their back.
"We're OK. Lilly here," they gesture to the woman, who on cue waves half-heartedly towards the others, "hasn't been feeling her best lately. She's doesn't do well with crowds, and she's been homesick for a while now. We can't really leave the island right now, so we thought maybe visiting some of the more traditional places might be a better place to relax while things calm down here."

"Ah, I see. Jose's probably the nearest place like that. Denada popular for people looking for the pre-rev experience as well, I believe.

"Jose's where we're headed. I've haven't heard of Denada before, I'll look into them" for now.

[[Description for The Sphere and Lance. Lahti/Gale now works as a counterpart replacement for her Jakkai counterpart. In the more silly Yohz Hylan counterpart, she is replaced by a Squee counterpart of her Jakkai iteration. In either case, Rally is probably best left as a Squee]]

Warm, bright, and friendly, the Sphere and Lance is a shop that was clearly not built to accomdate the size of Squee. Heavily polsihed wooden floors and walls shine, creating mirrored images of the decor and displays. The number of isles of shelves to browse through is modest, but the woman at the counter is cheery and welcoming.

The counter is relatively large for the establishment, built into an extended L cut forming almost a cup of space. The front display of it is glass, and the top of the counter in spaots is either glass or wood. Various signs all around the store indicate discounts on pary planning services, bonus incentives for ordering large balloon bundles in bulk, and additional niche services that are available for those of particular interest.

The room is filled with a variety of balloon displays all over, all of which for sale as-is or already sold and ready to deploy for celebration. The balloon arrangement to her right (viewers left) in particular is a set of golden metallic balloons, creamy off-white balloons, sharp lemony yellow balloons, and the occasional green or black jewel-tone balloon all arranged in a spiraling vertical column.

[[Cheat Day: TRy just writing a character desc?]]

Cheery, friendly, playful to a fault, and regularly loud. First Post is a generalist member of the Revelry cell of the Yohz Hylan Squee Helibuster Militia Defense Force. While she doesn't take pleasure in hurting others, she enjoys physical contact and has an abnomally high success rate during first-time combat encounters.

Her preferred combat projectile are her own pink Null Shells. But her actual combat tactics heavily favor the pounce-and-pin to crush approach to defining 

It was a relatively quiet day in the Hot Tropics. Customers frequently made their orders online, passed by the pickup lane to get their food, and left to eat. While the seats and tables were still in place to accomodate many patrons, it had been years since all of the seats had been filled. And this was fine. Less maintence. Less confrontations with upset customers. While sometimes the amount of orders coming in might be more than they could ever possibly fill at once- and issue they seldom had when people were accustomed to ordering in person- more often than not there pwas ample time to rest, relax, think, read, or clean between orders. And with little fear of appearing to not take their work in front of their clients, Spica and Miela enjoyed chatting with eachother or with the customers now and then. Though the missed the old arrangement, the horse-women became comfortable with the new work cadence.

Today is a bit different. 

[[You didn't actually write anything for day 8 silly, you let Terraria rule your life and your schedule. You're stronger than this. Don't let it keep going.]]

[[The following is a reflection on my experience with NaNoWriMo so far:]]

[[
Four lessons from my first week of trying to force a novel into existence

1:  "Write Every Day" sounds all fine and dandy until getting sick from eating some funky food or having an emotional argument with friends. Trying to write "happy fun fake-sports tournament" through that feels baaaaaaad.

2: Cheat Days are still Hard Days. When I was doing art challenges, I had "cheat day" prompts lined up, specifically so I could reach a quick finish on something low effort when I was feeling unwell. I tried doing a similar setup for NaNoWriMo and it is not working at all. First, because the cheat day prompts don't actually fit anywhere in the novel and so get forced in the back of it in a weird out of order glossary thing making it awkward to share. Second, because even an easy writing prompt takes a good chunk of time for me to write. I can't do a 15 minute "quick sketch" and get anywhere near 3k words.

3: "Show Don't Tell" is slow to write. It makes for a better reading experience most of the time, but but this turns into an easy detour into 30+ minutes of "research" when trying to do this for any situation I don't have more than surface level familiarity with. Trying to fudge the logistics, or just sticking a convenient timeskip at the exact moment of "I don't know how this part actually works" feels bad. The goal of NaNo is to just get a draft, not necessarily a good one. So I need to force myself to stop letting this be a pace breaker.

4: Writing the boring parts in my novel is at least as boring as reading the boring parts in other's novels, if not moreso. Somehow I just assumed all writers liked writing all of the parts of their stories. But I started my story with one of my popular characters so I could try to define what normalcy is, but I'm stuck spending days of my life trying to detail the logistics of a roadtrip instead of exploring a character questioning what it means to be a human that I wanted to do in the first place. I should probably just jump ahead and come back to the boring bits if I'm ever looking at getting past draft 1. 
basically what I'm saying is "art is hard"
]]

Seated at the tables in front of the display windows are a pair of cozy friends. One, a petite brown bear in an oversized red cartoon-bearing shirt and a black denim vest. Her name is Feluxutiria- as is written on her backback. The other, a quadruped that looked in all respects like a sparkly blue miniture horse with pointy weaponized party hat attached to its forehead.

It's clear the two are close. The way they stick togehter at all times. The way the bear could ramble at length about the most inane things and have the blue one nod eagery to it. The way that despite saying few words, the blue one seemed at ease and perfectly understood by their companion.

"We'll have a double order of the salmon meal, please." The beaer had ordered.

Miela had heard word about the "Toys" around town, and how in the past they had had quite the conflict with the broader community living on the island. And while she had seen a few now and then in other shops or passing about during the day to day, she had never really gotten to known any nor really spoken to any much. She had never ever seen one show an interest in the Hot Tropics before.

It was as if the Toys didn't eat at all, or at least didn't eat the same kind of food the other people around tended to eat. That did make intuitive sene to her. After all, when one buys a toy plush cat, that is with the expectation that they won't need to eat it. So why would Toy People need to eat anything either?

She brought the freshly cooked meals to the table. Both, pristine white dishes with a bed of rice on top, heled in place by a healthy helping of zesty seasoned salmon and topped with a small variety of mixed herbs and spices. Miela nodded to both of them and smiled.

"Thanks for ordering at the Hot Tropics! We hope you enjoy your meal!" She promptly laid out the utensiles for the both of them with the practiced ease of someone who's done this routine thousands of times, beamed a warm grin at the both of the patrons, then retreated back behind the counter to reseume work taking glances at the pair when time permitted.
